Analyzes game log data for an individual baseball player with the goal of identifying how often the player gets at least one hit

Initial underlying data files for this project are sourced from the player pages on www.baseball-reference.com

This project is for analyzing player batter data at a game log level. 

It uses data saved down from the player page game log section and accepts one file at a time currently, though the analysis is easily repeated for each player data set that you want to use. 

It currently requires two inputs, the file name with the data, currently setup to be read in as a csv file, and the baseball season that the data covers. It currently only accepts up to a full season at time.
